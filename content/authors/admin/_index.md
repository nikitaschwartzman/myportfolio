  - title: Religion and Public Life Graduate Fellow

    date: '2022-10-25'
    awarder: Kenan Institute for Ethics, Duke University
    summary: |
      The Religions and Public Life program at the Kenan Institute for Ethics examines the impact of religions within historical and cultural contexts, focusing on how they shape the lives of their followers, interact across time and space, and contribute to the formation of public institutions. This year, twelve graduate fellows from Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill have been selected to join an interdisciplinary group that will explore the role of religion in contemporary social and political issues. The theme for this year is "Religion, Peace and War," in response to global changes in 2022.

      Professor Malachi Hacohen, reflecting on the group's focus, states, “In an era where borders are closing and walls are being built, this interdisciplinary graduate student group is offering a model of collaboration for the world. By bringing together students from Divinity and the Graduate School, supported by the Kenan Institute for Ethics, the Center for Jewish Studies, Duke Islamic Studies Center, and Duke University Middle East Studies Center, graduate students studying various regions will examine the connections between immigration and religion, looking for religious pathways to rebuild human life.” Throughout the academic year, the group will discuss and develop their individual projects, supporting one another and creating opportunities for collaboration. At the end of the fellowship, their work will be published on the Religions and Public Life website.

## About Me

I am an M.A. graduate from Duke University, with research focused on the intersection of gender dynamics, colonial theories, and religious law, particularly in Islamic contexts. Professionally, I have extensive experience in volunteer coordination, gender-based violence prevention, and survivor advocacy. My work integrates my academic insights with hands-on efforts to promote gender equality, community support, and social justice.
